# Task 1
I was the group leader for Team Wakanda. I created the repository, set up the environment and pushed it to the Team repository that was created by a team member. However, another team member pulled my commit, updated it and pushed it to the repository. I don't know how it happened, but I lost record of my pushes. I also worked on the smart contract together with a group member; Nwokoye Praise but he was the one who pushed it to the repo. So I had zero tangible proof to show for my participation in terms of writing codes during task 1 because most of my participation was done with remix plus we were the last group that was formed so we had 2 days to work. But here's the link to the repository:  

# Task 2 
I was still the group leader for Team Wakanda. So as usual, I created the repository, set up environment and pushed it to the Team repository. I also worked on unit test with a team member but I couldn't push my codes to the repository because I had electricity issues at the time before we presented. So I communicated with the team members and assisted him by typing it out through text on our WhatsApp group. The test wasn't perfectly written on the repo because he really didn't get it the way I explained. And Immediately after the presentation, we stopped pushing anything to the repository. However, I made some few commits and merged other people's commit. Here's the link to check all my commits:


#Task 3
We were regrouped. And my new is Team R.

For the new task, I worked on the smart contract and the unit test, made several pushes but I had delays of electricity issues. And I missed the presentation because I had lost power for the past 24hours and all other efforts to get back failed. But few hours ago, I got back and tried to finish up and fix all my errors. 
So here are my commits for Task 3:
