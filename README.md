## Task 1 - Nestcoin Reward Tool
I was the group leader for Team Wakanda. I created the repository, set up the environment and pushed it to the Team repository that was created by a team member. However, another team member pulled my commit, updated it and pushed it to the repository. Here's the link: https://github.com/Team-Wakanda/Nestcoin-rewards-tool-build/pull/4/commits/6c6534873bf49dd29e4c560f72a7984d196fb7d2. I don't know how it happened, but I lost record of my commit. I also worked on the smart contract together with a group member; Nwokoye Praise but he was the one who pushed it to the repo. So I had zero tangible proof to show for my participation in terms of writing codes during task 1 because most of my participation was done through meetings with team members while we use remix plus we were the last group that was formed so we had 2 days to work.

## Task 2 - NestLibrary
I was still the group leader for Team Wakanda. So as usual, I created the repository, set up environment and pushed it to the Team repository. The team member again, pulled it and updated and I lost the record from commit history. Here is the link to the commit he made: https://github.com/Team-Wakanda/NestLibrary/pull/1. I also worked on unit test with a team member but I couldn't push my codes to the repository because I had electricity issues at the time before we presented. So I communicated with the team members and assisted him by typing it out through text on our WhatsApp group. Here was the commit he made when he was done: https://github.com/Team-Wakanda/NestLibrary/pull/11. And Immediately after the presentation, we stopped pushing anything to the repository. However, I merged other a fellow team member's commit on the smart contract we both worked on:https://github.com/Team-Wakanda/NestLibrary/pull/7.

### Also took charge of the group presentation.

## Task 3 - Zuri Election Portal
We were regrouped. And my new team is Team R.

For the new task, I worked on the smart contract and the unit test, made several pushes but I had delays of electricity issues. And I missed the presentation because I had lost power for the past 24hours(from Friday to Midnight Sunday) and all other efforts to get back failed. But few minutes ago, I got back and tried to finish up and fix all my errors. But I found out the team already moved on and used an alternative while I was absent but my commits are still present. 


So here are my commits for Task 3..
